<p>Check out live demo!</p>
<p> Note: The app is hosted on heruko, initial page loading might take about 30 seconds for heruko front-end app to start up from sleep and first request to backend server might take 30 seconds for backend-server to start up from sleep, thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately heroku no longer has free tier plan, so the demo link won't work. I'm working to move it to a free alternative</p>

<p>I'm working on improving the app and adding additional functionalities. I'll soon be adding a detailed readme. </p>
 
<p>I spent considerable time on designing the user interface as well, so please check out the below behance link and leave a appreciation if you liked it and provide any suggestions for improvement</p>
